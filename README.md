# ProRLearn001-Implementation
Enhancing Vulnerability Detection using Prompt-tuning via Reinforcement Learning

Dataset
To investigate the effectiveness of ProRLearn, we adopt three vulnerability datasets from these papers:

Reveal: It originates from two open-source projects: Debian and Chromium. This dataset contains around 2k vulnerable entries and 20k non-vulnerable entries, vulnerabilities account for 9.16%.

FFMPeg+Qemu: It is derived from two open-source C projects and comprises approximately 10k vulnerable entries and 12k non-vulnerable entries, vulnerabilities account for 45.02%

Big-Vul: Fan et al. collected C/C++ functions from 348 open-source GitHub projects spanning from 2002 to 2019. This dataset contains approximately 10k vulnerable entries and 177k non-vulnerable entries, vulnerabilities account for 5.88%. 



Running the model:

The model implementation code is under the ProRLearn folder. 

If you want to reproduce our experimental results, please run load_ Model. py file.
